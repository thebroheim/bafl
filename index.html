                    It's the pre finals, last matches of regular season, penultimate uh week of the BAFL! Welcome back to the BAFL Times, we're nearly there I promise.
                    <br><br>
                    The week kicked off with a highly anticipated matchup between John and Lachlan. Lachlan was looking to secure his spot in the promotional playoffs. On the other hand John was playing for pure pride. But if you were an outsider looking in, you would've thought he was gonna get executed if he lost his match. I'm guessing Lachlan liked that narrative as he took John apart 5-0. Matthew and Ricardo rounded off their seasons with Matthew taking a convincing 4-1 to conclude his maiden BAFL season. Ricardo's goal of getting a win still aludes him, I haven't seen a dream snatched away this badly since I was told I couldn't be a doctor with a 54 ATAR.
                    <br><br>
                    Tuesday had a couple big matchups with El Classico taking place between Manjeeve and Jude. A win for Jude kept his playoff hopes alive as he dismantled the 'still on probation and probably wants to keep his job' Manjeeve 4-2. The other match featured none other than the man with a plan, trying to catch Sam if he can (me). I was gonna write something nice about Bass this week for taking the loss in his stride and being a good sport. But unfortunately he referred to me as Tom Morris during the week and after I calmed down from my 7 minute crashout I locked in to write this article. Dru also looking at you #PanthersFellOff.
                    <br><br>
                    Wednesday saw some huge controversy with the decisive matchup between Lachy W and Justin had to be postponed to Thursday. Sources close to me have reported that Lachy W was so frightened of Justin he demanded he stay home for the day out of pure fear. That may be some hyperbole from our on the floor journalism but thats all that we have. Fortunately another big matchup between Dru and Brent took place, with the winner going through to the Div 1 finals and the loser playing the relegation match. It was a tight contest with a late 90th minute offside preventing Brent from taking the lead sadly handing Dru the draw which was enough to see him home. Brent was heard blaming a 3rd leg for the offside, something he tells me he is all too familar with. 
                    <br><br>
                    To cap off the final match of the BAFL regular season, we had a highly anticipated matchup. A win for Lachy W put him into the playoffs for promotion but a loss or a draw would put Jude in the drivers seat. This was one of the few matches I've watched start to finish (I think I have ADHD idk) and my word it was definitely one the 'games of all time'. An early red card to Justin set the tone as Lachy W threw everything at this match, breaking the TV as he took the quote literally. A comfortable 3-0 victory set an all Lachlan matchup for a spot in the promise land, Division 1.

                    Wow, what a week in football (soccer). Upsets... people actually getting upset at a workplace video game. There hasn't been this much angst amongst a group of men since I ran out of beer on Melbourne Cup day. Welcome back to the BAFL Times.
                    <br><br>
                    Due to the Labour Day weekend, I was rudely awoken on Tuesday by my mother running into my room yelling the upcoming matchups for this week. We had decisive matches up the wazoo as we began the week with John taking on Ricardo. Why is this decisive? Well John guaranteed his spot in Division 1 with a 5-0 win (he was probably already guaranteed, I just CBA doing the math). The other match between hahahaha... Lachlan and Manjeeve. Lachlan hahaha came into the match super confident predicting a 5-1 hahahaha win. He instead proved to the BAFL, pride always comes before a fall. Known as Bayer 04 'Never'Lusen, Lachlan ruined the mantra conceding a 3-2 loss to Manjeeve who hadn't had a win in over 3 weeks.
                    <br><br>
                    Wednesday saw a top of the table clash between Dan and Sam. Dan previously called the BAFL Times shit, and Sam is an arrogant twat sitting atop his Division 1 throne. So from my perspective I wanted both to break their thumbs on the finesse button. After my clear bias subsided I watched as Sam defeated Dan 4-0 who has now secured minor premier spot in Division 1. I didn't get to see much of Jude vs Matthew, probably talking to my many girlfriends (I'm in heavy denial) but Jude took a big 3-2 win in the end which was filled with 'bicycle kicks, rabonas and scorpions' and that was just the first goal. Cheers Dru for the rundown!
                    <br><br>
                    Thursday had some ripping matchups take place. Matthew took on Lachy W, Lachy rocked the proud team of Ed Sheeran as he decided to make Matthew his 'Galway Girl' (yep the jokes just write themselves) as he 'Shape of You'd' ahhh I ruined it. It was 2-0. Jude backed up for the second time in as many days with a very important mid table matchup against Justin. The retirement party might have to be put on hold as Justin ran away from Jude's Espanyol, more like EspanLOL am I right?? In a big 5-3 win that might get him a chance at promotion. I say 'might' because Lachlan and Sam really need to get their act together, it's week 5 and we still don't know how the Division 2 promotions work. Get a real commissioner in! Like Alex Vil......[This messaged has been removed]

                <p>
It’s Week 4, and I’ve already lost most of my passion for these articles. Losing motivation after just three weeks? Just call me Essendon. Welcome back to the BAFL Times.
<br><br>
The week kicked off with Matthew taking on Lachlan in a decisive matchup that could shape the final Division 2 standings. Lachlan put six goals past Matthew with Juventus—remember when Juventus were good? Yeah, me neither, and I’m Italian. Meanwhile, Dru faced off against Dan in the battle of the Double D’s (that joke had to be verified by the commissioners). Dan, playing as Shakhtar Donetsk—or Shakhar Donesk? Shakeher Doner? Yeah, that Ukrainian team—ran away with an 8-1 win. On the BAFL website, the scoreline looks like a guitar!
<br><br>
Tuesday saw Lachy W return with a big Wearne W (he told me to say that). A close 2-1 victory keeps his playoff hopes alive. Justin and Lachlan also squared off, with Justin playing as Real Sociedad—I wish I could find my real sociedad… that milk must’ve gone off by now. In a déjà vu performance, Lachlan put another six goals past his opponent to solidify a top-two spot.
<br><br>
On Wednesday, the BAFL Times’ very own secured a massive 3-1 win over Dan. Post-match, Dan was quoted saying, “F*** you, Alex,” and that the BAFL Times is shit. He also said this mere hours after interviewing my cousin—gonna be an awkward family reunion. Meanwhile, Manjeeve took on Justin in what was expected to be an easy win for Manjeeve. Oh, how wrong we were. But are we even surprised at this point? The biggest fall-off since Ben Simmons, I reckon. Justin, ever the sportsman, praised his opponent’s effort. Manjeeve, on the other hand, blamed FC 25’s coding for his loss. There’s an ironic joke about sports gaming companies in there somewhere.
<br><br>
Finally, Thursday marked the return of Bass after a brief layoff (blame the commissioners), but Dru had no interest in rolling out the red carpet, securing a hard-fought 3-2 victory. Manjeeve, desperate for redemption, had a chance to take down Division 2 leader John. He entered with confidence, ready to prove he was back in business. And by “business,” I mean MySpace. John walked away—well, more of a slow trot—with a dominant 6-1 win. The very real possibility of a wooden chopsticks finish still looms, but who knows? The BAFL is full of twists and turns!

                    Read so nice, I had to do it thrice! Welcome back to the third installment of the BAFL Times, now featuring post-match interviews to give you an in-depth look at the emotional side of BAFL.
                    <br><br>
                    The week kicked off with a heated clash between Brent and Dan, with Dan emerging victorious in a dominant 4-0 win. It's worth noting that Brent went undefeated in Division 2 last season—a skill gap some might say is bigger than Freddie Mercury’s teeth. The battle of the undefeated saw John take on Justin, with John shooting down Justin’s Arsenal (haha, get it… because…).
                    <br><br>
                    Tuesday brought early controversy when Jude delayed his match to 3:30, only to back out altogether against Lachy W. Some speculated it was nerves, but given he was facing Lachy… well, that theory doesn’t really hold up. Fortunately John put his undefeated record on the line to beat Lachy 1-0. See Jude, nothing to worry about! The other match almost warrants a paragraph by itself, but I won't (something about HTML code says Sam). Lachlan tore Ricardo a new one by equalling the goal scoring record with a 13-0 win. Topped off with 25 shots, Ricardo probably would've had more success using the Be A Pro camera for his goalie as the man who originally set the record for the worst loss now has the joint record for the biggest win, swings and roundabouts ay?
                    <br><br>
                    Following his victory, Lachlan described himself as a “walking god” and an “aggressor with no mercy.” Yeah, he actually said that. I reckon Trump has fewer haters. Lachy also expressed confidence ahead of his upcoming match against Jude, accompanied by plenty of Lei noises throughout his game—long live the pshhhhhh, very cooool king.
                    <br><br>
                    Wednesday brought a top-of-the-table showdown between Sam and Alex in a high-class match. Despite averaging 10 goals per game in his last three outings, Alex was held to just three in a 5-3 loss. He was later seen bawling his eyes out aggressively at his desk. Oh wait… was I supposed to leave that part out? Sam called the match “hard-fought”—though he did finger quotations while saying it, so take that as you will. Meanwhile, Jude suffered an upset loss to Lachy W, who showed humility in victory by calling Jude “the easiest opponent” he’s ever faced. Good luck on the dole next week, Lachy! 
                    <br><br>
                    To wrap up the week, Jude had a shot at redemption against Ricardo—and he took it with both hands. A commanding 6-0 win restored his confidence, which he described as a “business as usual” performance. The final match of the week saw Manjeeve take on Matthew. I watched this one with my mouth wide open (not because I’m a mouth breather) but because I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. A 90th-minute winner from Matthew snatched victory away from Manjeeve, giving Matthew his first-ever BAFL win. Matthew credited the circle button for his success. Meanwhile, post-match, Manjeeve sounded eerily like my ex just before we broke up, assuring me that he was “fine” and that “everything is all good.” Thus ends a big week in the BAFL.

                <p>Welcome, one and all, to the BAFL Times: Week 2. Believe it or not, I’ve been renewed for a second edition. Much like the Brazilian national team, let’s dive right into it!
                    <br/><br/>
                    The week kicked off with a crucial Division One match between Sam and Dru. And let’s just say—I’ve seen wet paper bags put up a bigger fight than Dru (whose name, I must say, feels a bit misleading). A brutal 13-0 loss, tying the record for the biggest defeat, sent shockwaves through the BAFL and Big Ant communities, raising serious alarm bells. Meanwhile, John took on Jude, who, feeling confident in his job security, secured a win and extended his season to a perfect 2-0 start.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Tuesday featured the Battle of Italy (referring to the teams, not Brent himself—his ancestors were on the First Fleet, I think). The match ended in a dramatic draw after a 90th-minute equalizer from Brent shattered Bass’s hopes. #OnlyOneJester. Elsewhere, Justin faced off against Matthew in a 2-2 result, keeping Justin’s undefeated (redemption? comeback? unretired?) season alive. Remarkably, a record four Division 2 players remain unbeaten.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Wednesday was an emotional rollercoaster for the BAFL—not in a sad way, but because Lachy and Lachlan simply would not shhuuutt uuuupppp. You’d think they were football philosophers, but then again, here I am, writing articles about a workplace FIFA league. After polishing off some delightful noodles (courtesy of the generous Big Ant Studios), I was met with the horrific stench of Division 2 gameplay. The matchup drew a huge crowd, almost enough to bring back social distancing. Unfortunately, they were met with a 2-2 draw—where every goal came from turnovers—left neither Lachy W nor Lachlan with a win, but it did keep Lachy W’s undefeated streak alive and Lachlan firmly in Division 2, where many believe he belongs.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Finally, Thursday wrapped up the week with some intriguing matchups: Dru vs. Alex and Manjeeve vs. Ricardo. Manjeeve, who has been playing more games than my ex-girlfriend, put his Miyagi-like training to good use with a dominant 3-0 win over Ricardo. Meanwhile, Alex handed Dru another tough loss, this time 4-0, setting up a clash with Sam next week.
                    <br/><br/>
                    So, if you don’t hear from me next week... uh... it’s because... I...</p>

                <h2>Season 9 Week 1</h2>
                <p><small>Published on: Feb 14, 2025</small></p>
                <p><small>Author: Alex Villani</small></p>
                <p>On the opening week of the 9th installment of the BAFL, we were treated to an exciting lineup of matches. The league welcomed some newcomers, including Bass and Matthew, while Justin made his return from a six-week retirement, claiming he was a changed man and ready for the season ahead. <br> <br>
                    Before the season officially began, a one-off playoff match was held between Season 8 Division 2 winner Brent and the confident newcomer Bass to determine Bass’s placement for the upcoming season. After a hard-fought battle, Brent secured a 2-1 victory, convincing the commissioners that Bass was worthy of a spot in Division 1.
                    <br><br>
                    To start off the season we had the newbies spread their wings with defeats in their first ever matches. Although Bass proved his worth against Season 8 runner up Dan in a 3-2 loss. Lachlan who controversially went down to Division 2 despite some last minute punch-ons with the board. He was determined to prove the doubters wrong, he did so by losing to Jude 4-3. At least he'll keep his job... 
                    <br><br>
                    During the week, the BAFL was saddened at the sudden loss of Lei who decided to follow his work dreams to Sydney... sorry, his wife's work dreams to Sydney and bowed out of the tournament knowing full well prior he wouldn't be able to compete. Which is like meal prepping everyday then ordering Uber Eats after work anyways. We will forever miss you Lei, your win in Season 5 of the BAFL will never be forgotten (except when I had to fact check it) <br> <br>
                    To conclude the week, we had some very interesting matchups including the highly anticipated Lachy W vs Manjeeve matchup and the Battle of the Bottom with Ricardo and Justin. Ricardo broke a run of 8 straight divison matches without a goal, by scoring 2 in a 2-2 draw with Justin, we are still yet to find a conclusion to the Battle of the Bottom. 
                    <br><br>
                    Fans gathered in their 10s for the matchup of Lachy W and Manjeeve, tempers flaired early with Manjeeve controversially playing a practice match prior to his actual match during lunchtime. The jury is still out on this and Lachy is still pissed. Getting back to the match, it was a proper snoozefest, no goals, no skill, no passion. It made the recent Superbowl look like the 1998 Bulls Season. 
                    <br><br>
                    To cap off the final match of the week we had Bass take on defending champion Sam in match 4. This match reminded me of Finding Nemo, where Bass was Nemo trying to find himself while also trying to find his Dad and in the end he did, his name was Sam Harvey. A 12-1 defeat spread speculation and sparred heavy critcism of the move to put Bass in Division 1, however time will tell as there is much to play for in Season 9.</p>
