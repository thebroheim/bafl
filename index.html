                <p>Welcome, one and all, to the BAFL Times: Week 2. Believe it or not, I’ve been renewed for a second edition. Much like the Brazilian national team, let’s dive right into it!
                    <br/><br/>
                    The week kicked off with a crucial Division One match between Sam and Dru. And let’s just say—I’ve seen wet paper bags put up a bigger fight than Dru (whose name, I must say, feels a bit misleading). A brutal 13-0 loss, tying the record for the biggest defeat, sent shockwaves through the BAFL and Big Ant communities, raising serious alarm bells. Meanwhile, John took on Jude, who, feeling confident in his job security, secured a win and extended his season to a perfect 2-0 start.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Tuesday featured the Battle of Italy (referring to the teams, not Brent himself—his ancestors were on the First Fleet, I think). The match ended in a dramatic draw after a 90th-minute equalizer from Brent shattered Bass’s hopes. #OnlyOneJester. Elsewhere, Justin faced off against Matthew in a 2-2 result, keeping Justin’s undefeated (redemption? comeback? unretired?) season alive. Remarkably, a record four Division 2 players remain unbeaten.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Wednesday was an emotional rollercoaster for the BAFL—not in a sad way, but because Lachy and Lachlan simply would not shhuuutt uuuupppp. You’d think they were football philosophers, but then again, here I am, writing articles about a workplace FIFA league. After polishing off some delightful noodles (courtesy of the generous Big Ant Studios), I was met with the horrific stench of Division 2 gameplay. The matchup drew a huge crowd, almost enough to bring back social distancing. Unfortunately, they were met with a 2-2 draw—where every goal came from turnovers—left neither Lachy W nor Lachlan with a win, but it did keep Lachy W’s undefeated streak alive and Lachlan firmly in Division 2, where many believe he belongs.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Finally, Thursday wrapped up the week with some intriguing matchups: Dru vs. Alex and Manjeeve vs. Ricardo. Manjeeve, who has been playing more games than my ex-girlfriend, put his Miyagi-like training to good use with a dominant 3-0 win over Ricardo. Meanwhile, Alex handed Dru another tough loss, this time 4-0, setting up a clash with Sam next week.
                    <br/><br/>
                    So, if you don’t hear from me next week... uh... it’s because... I...</p>

                <h2>Season 9 Week 1</h2>
                <p><small>Published on: Feb 14, 2025</small></p>

                <p>On the opening week of the 9th installment of the BAFL, we were treated to an exciting lineup of matches. The league welcomed some newcomers, including Bass and Matthew, while Justin made his return from a six-week retirement, claiming he was a changed man and ready for the season ahead. <br> <br>
                    Before the season officially began, a one-off playoff match was held between Season 8 Division 2 winner Brent and the confident newcomer Bass to determine Bass’s placement for the upcoming season. After a hard-fought battle, Brent secured a 2-1 victory, convincing the commissioners that Bass was worthy of a spot in Division 1.
                    <br><br>
                    To start off the season we had the newbies spread their wings with defeats in their first ever matches. Although Bass proved his worth against Season 8 runner up Dan in a 3-2 loss. Lachlan who controversially went down to Division 2 despite some last minute punch-ons with the board. He was determined to prove the doubters wrong, he did so by losing to Jude 4-3. At least he'll keep his job... 
                    <br><br>
                    During the week, the BAFL was saddened at the sudden loss of Lei who decided to follow his work dreams to Sydney... sorry, his wife's work dreams to Sydney and bowed out of the tournament knowing full well prior he wouldn't be able to compete. Which is like meal prepping everyday then ordering Uber Eats after work anyways. We will forever miss you Lei, your win in Season 5 of the BAFL will never be forgotten (except when I had to fact check it) <br> <br>
                    To conclude the week, we had some very interesting matchups including the highly anticipated Lachy W vs Manjeeve matchup and the Battle of the Bottom with Ricardo and Justin. Ricardo broke a run of 8 straight divison matches without a goal, by scoring 2 in a 2-2 draw with Justin, we are still yet to find a conclusion to the Battle of the Bottom. 
                    <br><br>
                    Fans gathered in their 10s for the matchup of Lachy W and Manjeeve, tempers flaired early with Manjeeve controversially playing a practice match prior to his actual match during lunchtime. The jury is still out on this and Lachy is still pissed. Getting back to the match, it was a proper snoozefest, no goals, no skill, no passion. It made the recent Superbowl look like the 1998 Bulls Season. 
                    <br><br>
                    To cap off the final match of the week we had Bass take on defending champion Sam in match 4. This match reminded me of Finding Nemo, where Bass was Nemo trying to find himself while also trying to find his Dad and in the end he did, his name was Sam Harvey. A 12-1 defeat spread speculation and sparred heavy critcism of the move to put Bass in Division 1, however time will tell as there is much to play for in Season 9.</p>
