        summary: `Hi, it's me again. Collingwood just lost to the Hawks and I'm reallyyyy not in the mood to write this. Full hate speech rant incoming, and Manjeeve and Bass are on my radars. Welcome back to the BAFL times.
                  <br><br>
                  We began the week with Dan pulling out of his match against Oscar — not the first time, mind you. Something has to come from the commissioner… I dunno, maybe give me an extra win or something? I filled in, of course. Felt like Volkanovski stepping in on short notice — except unlike him, I didn’t get my head caved in by a Dagestani. I took Lachy to the cleaners in a match that both gave Bass a chance at survival and kept my cousin out of the relegation battle. Just call me Mother Teresa. Ricardo then shocked the BAFL world (okay, small suburb) by actually putting up a fight for once. Jude failed to capitalise, and Ricardo secured his first BAFL point with a 3–3 draw.
                  <br><br>
                  Tuesday, we finally got the Dan v Oscar showdown we were supposedly all craving — though let’s be honest, no one really cared. The real highlight was Ben and Matthew’s season finale. With nothing on the line, they went all out. Punches thrown, insults hurled, and Matthew walked away 3–1. What a scrap, lads. Oh right — back to Division 1, if I must. Oscar shocked everyone by taking an early lead, but Dan fired up, booting the next four. Despite a late Oscar rally, Dan held on for a 4–3 win.
                  <br><br>
                  Right, if for some reason you’re standing — grab a seat. We’ve made it to Wednesday. For context, Manjeeve was 6–0 going into this match. Notice my use of was. A win would have secured him automatic promotion. Standing in his way was BAFL debutant Yasin, who delivered the biggest choke since Melbourne a couple weeks ago… and it wasn’t him choking. With his unmatched aura-farming ability, Yasin tore Manjeeve apart 6–3, knocking him to second place and putting promotion in jeopardy. We also had a top-of-the-table clash between Dan and Sam. Yes, Dan played twice in a row — I couldn’t believe it either. It was a tough battle, maybe even a preview of the Division 1 final. I say maybe, because obviously I’m winning the whole thing. Sam walked away with a 3–1 win and the Division 1 top spot.
                  <br><br>
                 If you thought Wednesday was peak BAFL, wait for Thursday. I forgot to order lunch — embarrassing, I know. Oh, and Lachlan (allegedly) picked his own team before confirming his match. Poor Jade had to endure a Real Madrid onslaught as the totally-not-corrupt commissioner racked up a 12–2 win. Someone investigate this man. With that, Lachlan secured automatic promotion over Manjeeve. And then… the final match of the season. Bass vs Dru. A win for Bass would keep him alive, a loss would drop him straight to Division 2. Being the philanthropist he is, Bass decided to “meet in the middle” with a draw to keep Dru in Division 1. Oh wait… that actually relegated Bass. Turns out he’s just bad at maths. Poor Bass. Finals incoming!`,

                  Monday kicked off with some decisive clashes. Bass faced off against Oscar, who was feeling overly confident and believed he could win with just nine men. 
                  Embracing his French roots, Bass put up a serious fight. Oscar scraped through with a draw — just barely. Meanwhile, Yasin continued his fairytale BAFL debut, smashing Matthew 4-1 and keeping his promotion hopes alive. 
                  What an inspiration that man is!

                  Tuesday brought one of the week’s most anticipated matchups: Brent vs. Lachy. The old allies — Germany and Italy — went head-to-head. Brent’s Germany emerged victorious, flexing a superior squadron. Lachy, in full Mussolini mode, retaliated by launching his controller into the downstairs TV. 
                  Division 2 wasn’t short on action either. Unbeaten Manjeeve faced his rival Jude in a top-of-the-table clash. With full sigma rizz energy, Manjeeve crushed Jude 4-1, keeping his unbeaten streak alive and planting one hand firmly on the promotion medal.
                  <br><br>
                  Wednesday belonged to Portugal. RONNNYYYYYY SUIIIIIII. Ricardo went hunting for his first BAFL win… and fell short again. Even with France, it wasn’t enough — though to be fair, he did put Mbappé in goal. 
                  Ben capitalized with a 2-1 win. Bass returned once more, as Sam — clearly still punishing him for going on holiday — scheduled him every second day. 
                  Bass threw the kitchen sink at Dan (pretty sure that’s against BAFL rules), but Dan clung on for a 2-1 win.

                  With so many international teams this week, the BAFL is starting to look like a desperate man’s Tinder location settings. Thursday opened with Yasin continuing his dream run against Jade. 
                  Channeling the power of the paella, his Spain dismantled Jade’s England 3-1. It was the BAFL version of the Anglo-Spanish War (1625–1630). Lachy also faced Dru downstairs, having finally retrieved his controller from the plasma. 
                  He let loose, taking down the season 9 finalist 5-3.
                  <br><br>
                  Friday. We made it. You ready? Let’s go. Wait — another international matchup? At this point, just call us NATO. 
                  Lachlan took on Matthew’s Portugal, but even the GOAT Bruno Fernandes couldn’t stop Lachlan's goal-hungry rampage, ending in a brutal 10-2 loss (shoutout to the Peninsular War). 
                  To close out the week, Bass faced Brent in a match with huge implications — Brent chasing finals, Bass avoiding relegation. 
                  A tight contest unfolded (or so I’m told — I was writing the rest of this recap with the match happening behind me). Brent clinched it 2-1, setting up a mouthwatering Dru vs. Bass clash next week.`,

                It was a rough week for the BAFL commissioners. Most participants were either on leave or struck down with a severe case of Manjeevitis. 
                However, on Monday, the Battle of the Bottom saw some life as Yasin took on Ricardo. 
                Neither had secured a BAFL win yet, but Yasin channelled his inner Hollow Hero and took Ricardo out with a 3-1 win. 
                I also played — not that it matters — but I made Dru pay full price for knocking me out of last season’s tournament by DESTROYING him 3-2 (granted, if the match had gone on two more minutes, I probably would’ve lost).
                <br><br>

                Oh look, it’s me again — saving the BAFL once more by actually turning up to work (looking at you, Lachlan). 
                After Sam spent 20 minutes assigning tactics to each player individually, we finally got underway. I lost. 
                Moving on. Elsewhere, Jude faced Ben in a surprisingly close encounter. 
                Spectators believe it was because Jude spent too much time admiring the Chelsea Women (court hearing next Monday), but he still walked away with a 3-0 victory.
                <br><br>

                Manjeeve’s unbeaten run continued with a huge 6-0 win. He claims his victories have nothing to do with harassing co-workers into playing during their precious lunch and afternoon breaks — jury’s still out on that. 
                In Division 1, Oscar took on Brent in a decisive match that could influence the all-important 4th place finish. (Because let’s be honest, I’m not dropping below 3rd. Smh.) 
                It was close, but Oscar walked away with the chocolates, 2-1.
                <br><br>

                Thursday marked the long-awaited return of Lachlan from his hiatus, and what a return it was. He faced Ricardo in what turned out to be a record-breaking 14-0 hammering. 
                Clearly, Lachlan is coping well with the Destiny raid fail. Lachlan now sits just one game behind Manjeeve for the automatic promotion spot — the division is really heating up. 
                To cap off the week, Lachy took on Dan. After dodging BAFL challenges all week, Dan finally showed his hand — and what a hand it was. Lachy, being the gentleman he is, welcomed Dan back by losing 4-0. And they say chivalry is dead, huh?`,

                    <br><br>
                    We started the week with some big wins in both Division 1 and Division 2. Sam — who suspiciously seems to have played every match this season with a women’s team — tore Bass apart with a 4-1 victory. 
                    Meanwhile, Manjeeve continued his insane run of form, dismantling Ben with a massive 9-0 win to keep his spot firmly at the top of the Division 2 table.
                    <br><br>
                    Tuesday kicked off with the battle of old enemies — not Dru and Brent, but England vs Germany. The match was tight until half-time, but much like the Germans, Dru couldn't finish strong as Brent stormed to a 5-2 victory (or invaded, depending on your historical perspective). 
                    Upstairs, Jade tried to carry last week’s momentum into their clash against Matthew, but fell short. Matthew's looking like a dark horse in the BAFL — and not just because of his luxurious hairstyle.
                    <br><br>
                    The war theme continued on Wednesday with a Falklands-esque showdown between Lachy and Oscar. Big up the penguins! Oscar, desperately needing a win, delivered a real edge-of-your-seat performance. 
                    And by edge of your seat, I mean I nearly hurled the chair at the downstairs TV. Pure rubbish football — but Oscar scraped a 3-2 win for his first ever BAFL victory, keeping his season alive. 
                    In other history-making news, Ben defeated Yasin, leaving only Ricardo and Yasin without a BAFL win. (I reallyyyy can't wait for that matchup).
                    <br><br>
                    To cap off the week, Dan pulled out of his match against yours truly. Some would say it was fear — and by "some," I mean me (most probably had Dan tipped to win). 
                    Sam and Dru stepped up for a spontaneous rematch of last year's final. Unfortunately, Sam still hasn’t recovered from his Brent loss and took it out on Dru with a brutal 6-0 win.
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, Manjeeve was back again, this time facing Ricardo. Ricardo, ever the showman, promised to be as loud and obnoxious as possible to throw Manjeeve off. 
                    It backfired spectacularly. Manjeeve cruised to a 7-0 win — and according to him, it should’ve been 12.`,

                    We kicked things off Monday with a couple of ‘uge clashes, lads. Bass and Lachy went head-to-head in a fiery encounter. 
                    I say fiery because Lachy deadass screamed four times while I was trying to concentrate on my Infinite Craft session. 
                    Pissed me right off. Still, he scraped out a 4-3 win. Lachlan, attempting to reinvent himself after his hilarious loss to Manjeeve last week, looked shaky early on—down 2-1 at halftime against Yasin. 
                    I don’t know what they put in the water at QA, but Lachlan came home strong, winning 6-2.
                    <br><br>
                    Tuesday was a monumental occasion: Brent vs. Sam. Brent’s odds were heavily stacked against him—think “me finding a wife on my Europe holiday in September” kind of odds (send me money). 
                    Somehow, Brent broke Sam’s year-long streak with an inspirational 4-3 victory, cementing his place in BAFL history. Matthew finally got to play his match this time around. 
                    I saw him blocking the door at 12:55 to stop Jude from playing, but Jude was far too strong. He broke in and channelled his rage into a 6-1 smashing.
                    <br><br>
                    Wednesday was drenched in controversy as Lachlan and Jude had to play twice in one week—mainly due to Manjeeve being sick every second day (gotta trick the disease, I guess). 
                    Jude entered as the heavy favourite, but vintage Lachlan (think season 8—I didn’t check) returned with a bang, thumping Jude 6-1 and rocketing to the top of Division 2. 
                    Sam’s PC was once again called into duty, but it clearly wasn’t used to high-quality FIFA gameplay, as the game crashed halfway through Dru and Dan’s match. 
                    They resumed at the 3:30 break, with Dan riding the momentum to a dominant 7-0 win.
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, Thursday brought a historic debut win for Jade, smashing Ricardo 4-0. It only took Jade two matches to record a BAFL win. 
                    Meanwhile, Ricardo is now on a 17-match losing streak—but I respect a man who always comes back for more. Back in Division 1, it was cousin vs. cousin, the Battle of the Dutch—Ajax vs. PSV. 
                    It was scrappy, and after taking a 3-1 lead late, and Oscar calling me a !@#$ in an otherwise peaceful downstairs office, I walked away with a 3-2 win!`,

                    Sam and Lachy launched Division 1, with Lachy graciously welcoming Sam’s Manchester United Women’s side by conceding 10 goals. What a ladies’ man! 
                    Yasin made his BAFL debut on Day 1, but it was Jude who stole the spotlight, making an early Division 2 statement with a commanding 5–0 win.

                    Tuesday opened with a clash between two familiar faces from the lower rungs of last season’s Division 2—Ricardo and Matthew. 
                    Unfortunately, Ricardo forgot the very clear 12:55 rule, leaving poor Matthew twiddling his thumbs as the commission board handed him his first win. 
                    At least Division 1 delivered, with Dan’s Lyon ripping through Chelsea. I’d say Brent’s Chelsea, but I don’t want to disrespect the badge—#AlwaysBlue.

                    Oh, would you look at that—it’s time to talk about my match! Of course I won. I had to after hyping myself up more than a Carlton fan welcoming a new coach. 
                    Bass didn’t stand a chance, as I walked away with a smooth 2–0 victory. Now, if you think I’m full of myself, wait ‘til you hear this next one. 
                    Lachlan faced Manjeeve in his opening match after boldly declaring in pre-season: “If I don’t go undefeated in this comp, I don’t deserve to be in the BAFL.” 
                    He followed up this inspirational claim with a 4–3 loss. Surprisingly, Lachlan had no comments post-match.
                    <br><br>
                    Finally—jeez these articles drag on, don’t they?—we had a Division 2 debut clash between Ben and Jade. By the 76th minute, once they figured out what the pass button was, the action truly began. 
                    A 1–1 draw couldn’t separate them, but it’s clear, exciting battles lie ahead. To wrap up the week, Oscar made his BAFL debut against Dru in what promised to be an exciting encounter. 
                    Unfortunately, Dru doesn’t believe in fairytale—beginnings or endings—as he cruised to a 3–0 win to kick off his campaign in style. Upon asking for an explanation Oscar provided me with words

      summary: `And just like that, another BAFL season has come to a dramatic close. A season filled with controversy, questionable tactics, and my personal suffering has officially wrapped up. But before I disappear into the abyss, let’s dive into the madness that was the BAFL Finals.
                    <br><br>
                    Monday saw a massive semi-final showdown: Alex vs. Dru. On paper, Alex was the favorite, but as we’ve learned many times in the BAFL, nothing goes to plan. Dru, rocking his now-iconic Real Madrid, managed to edge out a 1-0 victory in a match that had everything—tense build-up, incredible defensive efforts, and, of course, controversy. Alex played out of his skin, putting in a performance worthy of a final, but in classic BAFL fashion, the game was decided by a highly questionable penalty. Whether it was justified or not remains a heated debate (mostly in Alex’s head), but the result stood: Dru was through to the Grand Final
                    <br><br>
                    And so, the BAFL faithful (all 14 of them) gathered for the grand finale—Dru vs. Sam. Dru stuck with his battle-tested Real Madrid, while Sam was stuck with Tottenham, at least we can tell his code isn't scripted. But if there's one thing we know about Sam, it’s that he doesn’t lose finals. The match was an absolute nail-biter, with both players locked in a tight contest. Dru’s Madrid threw everything forward, but Sam’s tactical discipline and somehow reliable Spurs squad held firm. In the end, Sam got the crucial breakthrough and once again cemented his status as the BAFL champion. One off an illusive 3-peat, Sam remains the holder of all trophies.
                    <br><br>
                    And with that, the season is over. Tears were shed, controllers were definitely thrown, and I now have another invoice from head office for an unrelated post-match meltdown. Until next time, BAFL faithful—stay bitter!`,

Finals week kicked off in typical BAFL fashion: controversy. Sam and Alex’s match was scheduled before Lachlan and Lachy W’s promotion clash, which I personally found outrageous—mainly because I was woefully unprepared after a weekend of… well, let's not get into that. Getting dealt the incredibly even Real Madrid, Sam (who really needs a handicap at this point) cruised to a dominant 5-1 victory, securing yet another final appearance. Meanwhile, I was found post-match sobbing over the PS5 console, for which I now have an invoice from head office to clean.

Tuesday's match was a battle for relegation and redemption. Brent, who went undefeated last season, followed it up by failing to win a single game all year. Bass, a fresh face in the BAFL, showed equal commitment to this strategy by also not winning a match all season. Ironically this match ended up being a draw, their game was tightly contested, culminating in a dramatic penalty shootout, where Brent emerged victorious to cling to his Division 1 spot. (Personally, I think they should both be relegated.)
<br><br>
Wednesday brought even more controversy, as Lachlan and Lachy W’s match was delayed again. I haven't seen this much fear since watching my lord and savior, Mason Cox, get shitmixed by Rory Lobb last Friday night. Thankfully, BAFL fans (all 14 of them) weren’t left disappointed, as Dan and Dru stepped up for the first elimination final. There must be something in the Real Madrid water because Dru shocked the league by sending Dan packing in a 3-2 thriller. I'm deadass, playing as Real Madrid this season has always guaranteed a win. This victory sets up a semi-final showdown between Dru and myself (you bet I'm putting tickets on myself).
<br><br>
Thursday delivered the most anticipated match of the week—the Lachlan Showdown. Both players were evenly matched, and the crowd was massive—much to the frustration of UI programmers who must be over us by now. Lachlan T took an early 2-0 lead, but with his back against the wall, Lachy W clawed one back before halftime. As the match intensified, Lachy W defied logic by repeatedly shooting with Haaland’s right foot (he’s left-footed), while Lachlan somehow managed to miss sweaty goals—seriously, how is that even possible? But nothing could prepare us for the ending. I’m not kidding—I’m still trying to process it. In a moment of absolute madness, Lachy W executed the bold strategy of slide tackling Lachlan’s keeper to score a 92nd-minute winner, securing his place in Division 1. A true fairytale ending to Week 1 of the BAFL Finals. And there's still so much more to come!
<br><br>
Finally we bid a sad fairwell to Justin as he departs back to his sacred land and thus ending his career on the BAFL. Justin, who came out of retirement to record inspirational wins against Manjeeve and Jude will forever warm our hearts. I'll personally miss the 3am phone calls to discuss the upcoming articles and the constant harassment for an early copy. We wish you well Justin!`,

                    The week kicked off with a highly anticipated matchup between John and Lachlan. Lachlan was looking to secure his spot in the promotional playoffs. On the other hand John was playing for pure pride. But if you were an outsider looking in, you would've thought he was gonna get executed if he lost his match. I'm guessing Lachlan liked that narrative as he took John apart 5-0. Matthew and Ricardo rounded off their seasons with Matthew taking a convincing 4-1 to conclude his maiden BAFL season. Ricardo's goal of getting a win still aludes him, I haven't seen a dream snatched away this badly since I was told I couldn't be a doctor with a 54 ATAR.

                    Tuesday had a couple big matchups with El Classico taking place between Manjeeve and Jude. A win for Jude kept his playoff hopes alive as he dismantled the 'still on probation and probably wants to keep his job' Manjeeve 4-2. The other match featured none other than the man with a plan, trying to catch Sam if he can (me). I was gonna write something nice about Bass this week for taking the loss in his stride and being a good sport. But unfortunately he referred to me as Tom Morris during the week and after I calmed down from my 7 minute crashout I locked in to write this article. Dru also looking at you #PanthersFellOff.
                    <br><br>
                    Wednesday saw some huge controversy with the decisive matchup between Lachy W and Justin had to be postponed to Thursday. Sources close to me have reported that Lachy W was so frightened of Justin he demanded he stay home for the day out of pure fear. That may be some hyperbole from our on the floor journalism but thats all that we have. Fortunately another big matchup between Dru and Brent took place, with the winner going through to the Div 1 finals and the loser playing the relegation match. It was a tight contest with a late 90th minute offside preventing Brent from taking the lead sadly handing Dru the draw which was enough to see him home. Brent was heard blaming a 3rd leg for the offside, something he tells me he is all too familar with. 
                    <br><br>
                    To cap off the final match of the BAFL regular season, we had a highly anticipated matchup. A win for Lachy W put him into the playoffs for promotion but a loss or a draw would put Jude in the drivers seat. This was one of the few matches I've watched start to finish (I think I have ADHD idk) and my word it was definitely one the 'games of all time'. An early red card to Justin set the tone as Lachy W threw everything at this match, breaking the TV as he took the quote literally. A comfortable 3-0 victory set an all Lachlan matchup for a spot in the promise land, Division 1.

      summary: `      Wow, what a week in football (soccer). Upsets... people actually getting upset at a workplace video game. There hasn't been this much angst amongst a group of men since I ran out of beer on Melbourne Cup day. Welcome back to the BAFL Times.

                    Due to the Labour Day weekend, I was rudely awoken on Tuesday by my mother running into my room yelling the upcoming matchups for this week. We had decisive matches up the wazoo as we began the week with John taking on Ricardo. Why is this decisive? Well John guaranteed his spot in Division 1 with a 5-0 win (he was probably already guaranteed, I just CBA doing the math). The other match between hahahaha... Lachlan and Manjeeve. Lachlan hahaha came into the match super confident predicting a 5-1 hahahaha win. He instead proved to the BAFL, pride always comes before a fall. Known as Bayer 04 'Never'Lusen, Lachlan ruined the mantra conceding a 3-2 loss to Manjeeve who hadn't had a win in over 3 weeks.
                    <br><br>
                    Wednesday saw a top of the table clash between Dan and Sam. Dan previously called the BAFL Times shit, and Sam is an arrogant twat sitting atop his Division 1 throne. So from my perspective I wanted both to break their thumbs on the finesse button. After my clear bias subsided I watched as Sam defeated Dan 4-0 who has now secured minor premier spot in Division 1. I didn't get to see much of Jude vs Matthew, probably talking to my many girlfriends (I'm in heavy denial) but Jude took a big 3-2 win in the end which was filled with 'bicycle kicks, rabonas and scorpions' and that was just the first goal. Cheers Dru for the rundown!
                    <br><br>
                    Thursday had some ripping matchups take place. Matthew took on Lachy W, Lachy rocked the proud team of Ed Sheeran as he decided to make Matthew his 'Galway Girl' (yep the jokes just write themselves) as he 'Shape of You'd' ahhh I ruined it. It was 2-0. Jude backed up for the second time in as many days with a very important mid table matchup against Justin. The retirement party might have to be put on hold as Justin ran away from Jude's Espanyol, more like EspanLOL am I right?? In a big 5-3 win that might get him a chance at promotion. I say 'might' because Lachlan and Sam really need to get their act together, it's week 5 and we still don't know how the Division 2 promotions work. Get a real commissioner in! Like Alex Vil......[This messaged has been removed]

      summary: `It’s Week 4, and I’ve already lost most of my passion for these articles. Losing motivation after just three weeks? Just call me Essendon. Welcome back to the BAFL Times.
                <br><br>
                The week kicked off with Matthew taking on Lachlan in a decisive matchup that could shape the final Division 2 standings. Lachlan put six goals past Matthew with Juventus—remember when Juventus were good? Yeah, me neither, and I’m Italian. Meanwhile, Dru faced off against Dan in the battle of the Double D’s (that joke had to be verified by the commissioners). Dan, playing as Shakhtar Donetsk—or Shakhar Donesk? Shakeher Doner? Yeah, that Ukrainian team—ran away with an 8-1 win. On the BAFL website, the scoreline looks like a guitar!
                <br><br>
                Tuesday saw Lachy W return with a big Wearne W (he told me to say that). A close 2-1 victory keeps his playoff hopes alive. Justin and Lachlan also squared off, with Justin playing as Real Sociedad—I wish I could find my real sociedad… that milk must’ve gone off by now. In a déjà vu performance, Lachlan put another six goals past his opponent to solidify a top-two spot.
                <br><br>
                On Wednesday, the BAFL Times’ very own secured a massive 3-1 win over Dan. Post-match, Dan was quoted saying, “F*** you, Alex,” and that the BAFL Times is shit. He also said this mere hours after interviewing my cousin—gonna be an awkward family reunion. Meanwhile, Manjeeve took on Justin in what was expected to be an easy win for Manjeeve. Oh, how wrong we were. But are we even surprised at this point? The biggest fall-off since Ben Simmons, I reckon. Justin, ever the sportsman, praised his opponent’s effort. Manjeeve, on the other hand, blamed FC 25’s coding for his loss. There’s an ironic joke about sports gaming companies in there somewhere.
                <br><br>
                Finally, Thursday marked the return of Bass after a brief layoff (blame the commissioners), but Dru had no interest in rolling out the red carpet, securing a hard-fought 3-2 victory. Manjeeve, desperate for redemption, had a chance to take down Division 2 leader John. He entered with confidence, ready to prove he was back in business. And by “business,” I mean MySpace. John walked away—well, more of a slow trot—with a dominant 6-1 win. The very real possibility of a wooden chopsticks finish still looms, but who knows? The BAFL is full of twists and turns!

                    <br><br>
                    The week kicked off with a heated clash between Brent and Dan, with Dan emerging victorious in a dominant 4-0 win. It's worth noting that Brent went undefeated in Division 2 last season—a skill gap some might say is bigger than Freddie Mercury’s teeth. The battle of the undefeated saw John take on Justin, with John shooting down Justin’s Arsenal (haha, get it… because…).
                    <br><br>
                    Tuesday brought early controversy when Jude delayed his match to 3:30, only to back out altogether against Lachy W. Some speculated it was nerves, but given he was facing Lachy… well, that theory doesn’t really hold up. Fortunately John put his undefeated record on the line to beat Lachy 1-0. See Jude, nothing to worry about! The other match almost warrants a paragraph by itself, but I won't (something about HTML code says Sam). Lachlan tore Ricardo a new one by equalling the goal scoring record with a 13-0 win. Topped off with 25 shots, Ricardo probably would've had more success using the Be A Pro camera for his goalie as the man who originally set the record for the worst loss now has the joint record for the biggest win, swings and roundabouts ay?
                    <br><br>
                    Following his victory, Lachlan described himself as a “walking god” and an “aggressor with no mercy.” Yeah, he actually said that. I reckon Trump has fewer haters. Lachy also expressed confidence ahead of his upcoming match against Jude, accompanied by plenty of Lei noises throughout his game—long live the pshhhhhh, very cooool king.
                    <br><br>
                    Wednesday brought a top-of-the-table showdown between Sam and Alex in a high-class match. Despite averaging 10 goals per game in his last three outings, Alex was held to just three in a 5-3 loss. He was later seen bawling his eyes out aggressively at his desk. Oh wait… was I supposed to leave that part out? Sam called the match “hard-fought”—though he did finger quotations while saying it, so take that as you will. Meanwhile, Jude suffered an upset loss to Lachy W, who showed humility in victory by calling Jude “the easiest opponent” he’s ever faced. Good luck on the dole next week, Lachy! 
                    <br><br>
                    To wrap up the week, Jude had a shot at redemption against Ricardo—and he took it with both hands. A commanding 6-0 win restored his confidence, which he described as a “business as usual” performance. The final match of the week saw Manjeeve take on Matthew. I watched this one with my mouth wide open (not because I’m a mouth breather) but because I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. A 90th-minute winner from Matthew snatched victory away from Manjeeve, giving Matthew his first-ever BAFL win. Matthew credited the circle button for his success. Meanwhile, post-match, Manjeeve sounded eerily like my ex just before we broke up, assuring me that he was “fine” and that “everything is all good.” Thus ends a big week in the BAFL.

      summary: `Welcome, one and all, to the BAFL Times: Week 2. Believe it or not, I’ve been renewed for a second edition. Much like the Brazilian national team, let’s dive right into it!
                    <br/><br/>
                    The week kicked off with a crucial Division One match between Sam and Dru. And let’s just say—I’ve seen wet paper bags put up a bigger fight than Dru (whose name, I must say, feels a bit misleading). A brutal 13-0 loss, tying the record for the biggest defeat, sent shockwaves through the BAFL and Big Ant communities, raising serious alarm bells. Meanwhile, John took on Jude, who, feeling confident in his job security, secured a win and extended his season to a perfect 2-0 start.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Tuesday featured the Battle of Italy (referring to the teams, not Brent himself—his ancestors were on the First Fleet, I think). The match ended in a dramatic draw after a 90th-minute equalizer from Brent shattered Bass’s hopes. #OnlyOneJester. Elsewhere, Justin faced off against Matthew in a 2-2 result, keeping Justin’s undefeated (redemption? comeback? unretired?) season alive. Remarkably, a record four Division 2 players remain unbeaten.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Wednesday was an emotional rollercoaster for the BAFL—not in a sad way, but because Lachy and Lachlan simply would not shhuuutt uuuupppp. You’d think they were football philosophers, but then again, here I am, writing articles about a workplace FIFA league. After polishing off some delightful noodles (courtesy of the generous Big Ant Studios), I was met with the horrific stench of Division 2 gameplay. The matchup drew a huge crowd, almost enough to bring back social distancing. Unfortunately, they were met with a 2-2 draw—where every goal came from turnovers—left neither Lachy W nor Lachlan with a win, but it did keep Lachy W’s undefeated streak alive and Lachlan firmly in Division 2, where many believe he belongs.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Finally, Thursday wrapped up the week with some intriguing matchups: Dru vs. Alex and Manjeeve vs. Ricardo. Manjeeve, who has been playing more games than my ex-girlfriend, put his Miyagi-like training to good use with a dominant 3-0 win over Ricardo. Meanwhile, Alex handed Dru another tough loss, this time 4-0, setting up a clash with Sam next week.
                    <br/><br/>

      summary: `On the opening week of the 9th installment of the BAFL, we were treated to an exciting lineup of matches. The league welcomed some newcomers, including Bass and Matthew, while Justin made his return from a six-week retirement, claiming he was a changed man and ready for the season ahead. <br> <br>
                    Before the season officially began, a one-off playoff match was held between Season 8 Division 2 winner Brent and the confident newcomer Bass to determine Bass’s placement for the upcoming season. After a hard-fought battle, Brent secured a 2-1 victory, convincing the commissioners that Bass was worthy of a spot in Division 1.
                    <br><br>
                    To start off the season we had the newbies spread their wings with defeats in their first ever matches. Although Bass proved his worth against Season 8 runner up Dan in a 3-2 loss. Lachlan who controversially went down to Division 2 despite some last minute punch-ons with the board. He was determined to prove the doubters wrong, he did so by losing to Jude 4-3. At least he'll keep his job... 
                    <br><br>
                    During the week, the BAFL was saddened at the sudden loss of Lei who decided to follow his work dreams to Sydney... sorry, his wife's work dreams to Sydney and bowed out of the tournament knowing full well prior he wouldn't be able to compete. Which is like meal prepping everyday then ordering Uber Eats after work anyways. We will forever miss you Lei, your win in Season 5 of the BAFL will never be forgotten (except when I had to fact check it) <br> <br>
                    To conclude the week, we had some very interesting matchups including the highly anticipated Lachy W vs Manjeeve matchup and the Battle of the Bottom with Ricardo and Justin. Ricardo broke a run of 8 straight divison matches without a goal, by scoring 2 in a 2-2 draw with Justin, we are still yet to find a conclusion to the Battle of the Bottom. 
                    <br><br>
                    Fans gathered in their 10s for the matchup of Lachy W and Manjeeve, tempers flaired early with Manjeeve controversially playing a practice match prior to his actual match during lunchtime. The jury is still out on this and Lachy is still pissed. Getting back to the match, it was a proper snoozefest, no goals, no skill, no passion. It made the recent Superbowl look like the 1998 Bulls Season. 
                    <br><br>
                    To cap off the final match of the week we had Bass take on defending champion Sam in match 4. This match reminded me of Finding Nemo, where Bass was Nemo trying to find himself while also trying to find his Dad and in the end he did, his name was Sam Harvey. A 12-1 defeat spread speculation and sparred heavy critcism of the move to put Bass in Division 1, however time will tell as there is much to play for in Season 9.</p>
