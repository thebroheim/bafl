                    Monday kicked off with some decisive clashes. Bass faced off against Oscar, who was feeling overly confident and believed he could win with just nine men. 
                    Embracing his French roots, Bass put up a serious fight. Oscar scraped through with a draw — just barely. Meanwhile, Yasin continued his fairytale BAFL debut, smashing Matthew 4-1 and keeping his promotion hopes alive. 
                    What an inspiration that man is!

                    Tuesday brought one of the week’s most anticipated matchups: Brent vs. Lachy. The old allies — Germany and Italy — went head-to-head. Brent’s Germany emerged victorious, flexing a superior squadron. Lachy, in full Mussolini mode, retaliated by launching his controller into the downstairs TV. 
                    Division 2 wasn’t short on action either. Unbeaten Manjeeve faced his rival Jude in a top-of-the-table clash. With full sigma rizz energy, Manjeeve crushed Jude 4-1, keeping his unbeaten streak alive and planting one hand firmly on the promotion medal.
                    <br><br>
                    Wednesday belonged to Portugal. RONNNYYYYYY SUIIIIIII. Ricardo went hunting for his first BAFL win… and fell short again. Even with France, it wasn’t enough — though to be fair, he did put Mbappé in goal. 
                    Ben capitalized with a 2-1 win. Bass returned once more, as Sam — clearly still punishing him for going on holiday — scheduled him every second day. 
                    Bass threw the kitchen sink at Dan (pretty sure that’s against BAFL rules), but Dan clung on for a 2-1 win.

                    With so many international teams this week, the BAFL is starting to look like a desperate man’s Tinder location settings. Thursday opened with Yasin continuing his dream run against Jade. 
                    Channeling the power of the paella, his Spain dismantled Jade’s England 3-1. It was the BAFL version of the Anglo-Spanish War (1625–1630). Lachy also faced Dru downstairs, having finally retrieved his controller from the plasma. 
                    He let loose, taking down the season 9 finalist 5-3.
                    <br><br>
                    Friday. We made it. You ready? Let’s go. Wait — another international matchup? At this point, just call us NATO. 
                    Lachlan took on Matthew’s Portugal, but even the GOAT Bruno Fernandes couldn’t stop Lachlan's goal-hungry rampage, ending in a brutal 10-2 loss (shoutout to the Peninsular War). 
                    To close out the week, Bass faced Brent in a match with huge implications — Brent chasing finals, Bass avoiding relegation. 
                    A tight contest unfolded (or so I’m told — I was writing the rest of this recap with the match happening behind me). Brent clinched it 2-1, setting up a mouthwatering Dru vs. Bass clash next week.`,

      summary: `Hey, remember me? I went missing for a week — caught deep in the Big Ant grind. Late hours, drama, stress — it had it all. 
                I earned a day in lieu, which I’m now spending writing this article. 
                You just can’t win sometimes.

                It was a rough week for the BAFL commissioners. Most participants were either on leave or struck down with a severe case of Manjeevitis. 
                However, on Monday, the Battle of the Bottom saw some life as Yasin took on Ricardo. 
                Neither had secured a BAFL win yet, but Yasin channelled his inner Hollow Hero and took Ricardo out with a 3-1 win. 
                I also played — not that it matters — but I made Dru pay full price for knocking me out of last season’s tournament by DESTROYING him 3-2 (granted, if the match had gone on two more minutes, I probably would’ve lost).
                <br><br>

                Oh look, it’s me again — saving the BAFL once more by actually turning up to work (looking at you, Lachlan). 
                After Sam spent 20 minutes assigning tactics to each player individually, we finally got underway. I lost. 
                Moving on. Elsewhere, Jude faced Ben in a surprisingly close encounter. 
                Spectators believe it was because Jude spent too much time admiring the Chelsea Women (court hearing next Monday), but he still walked away with a 3-0 victory.
                <br><br>

                Manjeeve’s unbeaten run continued with a huge 6-0 win. He claims his victories have nothing to do with harassing co-workers into playing during their precious lunch and afternoon breaks — jury’s still out on that. 
                In Division 1, Oscar took on Brent in a decisive match that could influence the all-important 4th place finish. (Because let’s be honest, I’m not dropping below 3rd. Smh.) 
                It was close, but Oscar walked away with the chocolates, 2-1.
                <br><br>

                Thursday marked the long-awaited return of Lachlan from his hiatus, and what a return it was. He faced Ricardo in what turned out to be a record-breaking 14-0 hammering. 
                Clearly, Lachlan is coping well with the Destiny raid fail. Lachlan now sits just one game behind Manjeeve for the automatic promotion spot — the division is really heating up. 
                To cap off the week, Lachy took on Dan. After dodging BAFL challenges all week, Dan finally showed his hand — and what a hand it was. Lachy, being the gentleman he is, welcomed Dan back by losing 4-0. And they say chivalry is dead, huh?`,

      summary: `I'm here later than usual, something about a Rugby League release. I didn't play this week in the BAFL so not much point in reading but Sam's forcing my hand. 
                    Welcome back to the BAFL Times.
                    <br><br>
                    We started the week with some big wins in both Division 1 and Division 2. Sam — who suspiciously seems to have played every match this season with a women’s team — tore Bass apart with a 4-1 victory. 
                    Meanwhile, Manjeeve continued his insane run of form, dismantling Ben with a massive 9-0 win to keep his spot firmly at the top of the Division 2 table.
                    <br><br>
                    Tuesday kicked off with the battle of old enemies — not Dru and Brent, but England vs Germany. The match was tight until half-time, but much like the Germans, Dru couldn't finish strong as Brent stormed to a 5-2 victory (or invaded, depending on your historical perspective). 
                    Upstairs, Jade tried to carry last week’s momentum into their clash against Matthew, but fell short. Matthew's looking like a dark horse in the BAFL — and not just because of his luxurious hairstyle.
                    <br><br>
                    The war theme continued on Wednesday with a Falklands-esque showdown between Lachy and Oscar. Big up the penguins! Oscar, desperately needing a win, delivered a real edge-of-your-seat performance. 
                    And by edge of your seat, I mean I nearly hurled the chair at the downstairs TV. Pure rubbish football — but Oscar scraped a 3-2 win for his first ever BAFL victory, keeping his season alive. 
                    In other history-making news, Ben defeated Yasin, leaving only Ricardo and Yasin without a BAFL win. (I reallyyyy can't wait for that matchup).
                    <br><br>
                    To cap off the week, Dan pulled out of his match against yours truly. Some would say it was fear — and by "some," I mean me (most probably had Dan tipped to win). 
                    Sam and Dru stepped up for a spontaneous rematch of last year's final. Unfortunately, Sam still hasn’t recovered from his Brent loss and took it out on Dru with a brutal 6-0 win.
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, Manjeeve was back again, this time facing Ricardo. Ricardo, ever the showman, promised to be as loud and obnoxious as possible to throw Manjeeve off. 
                    It backfired spectacularly. Manjeeve cruised to a 7-0 win — and according to him, it should’ve been 12.`,

        summary: `I'm back yet again, and—like always—I'm writing this when I’m supposed to be working. I think the best work gets done when there's no pressure. 
                    That’s probably why my audience is shrinking by the week. Anyway, here are eight match summaries no one asked for!

                    We kicked things off Monday with a couple of ‘uge clashes, lads. Bass and Lachy went head-to-head in a fiery encounter. 
                    I say fiery because Lachy deadass screamed four times while I was trying to concentrate on my Infinite Craft session. 
                    Pissed me right off. Still, he scraped out a 4-3 win. Lachlan, attempting to reinvent himself after his hilarious loss to Manjeeve last week, looked shaky early on—down 2-1 at halftime against Yasin. 
                    I don’t know what they put in the water at QA, but Lachlan came home strong, winning 6-2.
                    <br><br>
                    Tuesday was a monumental occasion: Brent vs. Sam. Brent’s odds were heavily stacked against him—think “me finding a wife on my Europe holiday in September” kind of odds (send me money). 
                    Somehow, Brent broke Sam’s year-long streak with an inspirational 4-3 victory, cementing his place in BAFL history. Matthew finally got to play his match this time around. 
                    I saw him blocking the door at 12:55 to stop Jude from playing, but Jude was far too strong. He broke in and channelled his rage into a 6-1 smashing.
                    <br><br>
                    Wednesday was drenched in controversy as Lachlan and Jude had to play twice in one week—mainly due to Manjeeve being sick every second day (gotta trick the disease, I guess). 
                    Jude entered as the heavy favourite, but vintage Lachlan (think season 8—I didn’t check) returned with a bang, thumping Jude 6-1 and rocketing to the top of Division 2. 
                    Sam’s PC was once again called into duty, but it clearly wasn’t used to high-quality FIFA gameplay, as the game crashed halfway through Dru and Dan’s match. 
                    They resumed at the 3:30 break, with Dan riding the momentum to a dominant 7-0 win.
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, Thursday brought a historic debut win for Jade, smashing Ricardo 4-0. It only took Jade two matches to record a BAFL win. 
                    Meanwhile, Ricardo is now on a 17-match losing streak—but I respect a man who always comes back for more. Back in Division 1, it was cousin vs. cousin, the Battle of the Dutch—Ajax vs. PSV. 
                    It was scrappy, and after taking a 3-1 lead late, and Oscar calling me a !@#$ in an otherwise peaceful downstairs office, I walked away with a 3-2 win!`,

        summary: `Its back, bigger, betterer than everer. the BAFL returns and I am so excited for season X!. Ex? Well that's a funny story actually, I texted her Happy Birthday last week and haven't heard back, I wonder if....

                    The brand-new, improved BAFL kicked off Monday with a fresh mix of teams—this time featuring both Women’s and Men’s international squads. Right out of the gate, we got a taste of the new variety. 
                    Sam and Lachy launched Division 1, with Lachy graciously welcoming Sam’s Manchester United Women’s side by conceding 10 goals. What a ladies’ man! 
                    Yasin made his BAFL debut on Day 1, but it was Jude who stole the spotlight, making an early Division 2 statement with a commanding 5–0 win.
                    <br><br>
                    Tuesday opened with a clash between two familiar faces from the lower rungs of last season’s Division 2—Ricardo and Matthew. 
                    Unfortunately, Ricardo forgot the very clear 12:55 rule, leaving poor Matthew twiddling his thumbs as the commission board handed him his first win. 
                    At least Division 1 delivered, with Dan’s Lyon ripping through Chelsea. I’d say Brent’s Chelsea, but I don’t want to disrespect the badge—#AlwaysBlue.
                    <br><br>
                    Oh, would you look at that—it’s time to talk about my match! Of course I won. I had to after hyping myself up more than a Carlton fan welcoming a new coach. 
                    Bass didn’t stand a chance, as I walked away with a smooth 2–0 victory. Now, if you think I’m full of myself, wait ‘til you hear this next one. 
                    Lachlan faced Manjeeve in his opening match after boldly declaring in pre-season: “If I don’t go undefeated in this comp, I don’t deserve to be in the BAFL.” 
                    He followed up this inspirational claim with a 4–3 loss. Surprisingly, Lachlan had no comments post-match.
                    <br><br>
                    Finally—jeez these articles drag on, don’t they?—we had a Division 2 debut clash between Ben and Jade. By the 76th minute, once they figured out what the pass button was, the action truly began. 
                    A 1–1 draw couldn’t separate them, but it’s clear, exciting battles lie ahead. To wrap up the week, Oscar made his BAFL debut against Dru in what promised to be an exciting encounter. 
                    Unfortunately, Dru doesn’t believe in fairytale—beginnings or endings—as he cruised to a 3–0 win to kick off his campaign in style. Upon asking for an explanation Oscar provided me with words 
                    I couldn't even repeat to myself in the mirror. `,
